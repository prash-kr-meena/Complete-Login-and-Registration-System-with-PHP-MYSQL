//inside pdo we have to give DSN string (ie. data source name ) which contains the driver for the specific

// well i have tried this and its not working this way . CHECK OUT the PDO  pdf  you have , this is the same given in that BUT its not working . --> don't know 
// SO DOING THE OLD WAY, ie selecting  manually..

// this will do the magic of always automatically choosing  the database, do this if you dont want to change the databases(here register)->(NOTE: i am talking about databases NOT  TABLES , that you can have many more and you can choose any of them.)
